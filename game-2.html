                        I first played this game about 2019. I was not a big fan of it so I decided to get mods to give me infinite resources.
                        I continued to not enjoy the game but I beat a lot of the bosses. I just did not understand the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the summer of 2022 I played the game again after playing Darkest Dungeon 2, as I really liked it. 
                        Somehow my love for the second game translated into enjoying the first game as well. 
                        I think a major reason why is because the game is actually just about managing resources, which I did not understand before.
                        The second game is much more segmented which made me realise that the original game is not about winning every time. 
                        It is about planning teams and allocating only as many resources as is required to complete certain tasks. 
                        That year I finished the base game on the "easy mode", and did not want to play it again after.

                    <h3>The Butcher's Circus</h3>
                    <p>
                        In 2023 I started playing the game again. This time however I did not play the base game.
                        This time I played the Butcher's Circus, inspired by the youtuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@sheperddoggy" target="_blank">Sheperd Doggy</a>.
                        The Butcher's Circus is a PvP arena using the same characters from the base game. It is very different to the base game. 
                        The goal in the arena is to kill the enemy characters no matter what. This means you do not care to keep your characters alive, or healthy for more than this fight.

                        My favourite team to play is known as the Kalashnikov. It got its name from it's creator Kalashnikov.
                        The strategy when using the team is to go as aggresive as possible only going for offensive moves except few exceptions.
                        The fast gameplay is one reason why I love this team. The other is that it is very strong against almsot any team. 
                        It has only one weakness which is so bad however that it is the only reason why it is not a meta team. 
                        That reason is known as the Flaggelant. He has a trinket which negates all of the damage type the team outputs.
