            <p> This is my website. It wa planned to be about sharing my game opinions
                 and fitting the marking scheme of the task for which it was made.

                From what you can see however I have given up on a lot of features. But why is that? 
                Well, I was not told we had such little time to do it all, so if it looks like it was made in 2-3 days, that's because it was.
            </p>

                There are some positives however. The game pages look well on desktop and close to my original idea.

                If you're wondering, the image is a picture of me edited in the style of Julian Opie. I made it over the summer holidays for an asignment.
                I made it on photopea in around 5 hours.

                Below this paragraph is a line of penguins dancing. It is there because I really like that gif. I could watch it for hours. 
                While making this website I found you can change the size of background images and accidentally made a seizure-enducing website powered by that penguin gif.
