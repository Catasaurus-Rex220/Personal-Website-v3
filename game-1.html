                <h2>Background</h2>
                <p>
                    Dark Souls Remastered is one of the first non-mobile games I played. 
                    I have spent hundreds of hours playing it. 
                    I have only ever played it on the PlayStation 4.
                </p>
                <h2>Game Knowledge</h2>
                <p>
                    I have beaten the game countless times with many classes. <br></br>
                    The best class in my opinion is the dex build. Here is why:
                    <ul>They are consistently strong throughout the game</ul>
                    <ul>You can wear heavier armour because your weapons are very light</ul>
                    <ul>You have access to ranged weapons (bows, crossbows, great-bows)</ul>
                </p>

                <p>They are however not the best when you consider new-game+.
                    The best class for that is definitely mage, 
                    however even a strength build is better for new-game+ than dex.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <b>Sorcery Is Overpowered</b>  in the first dark souls game. 
                    They don't need to upgrade their weapons. They have access to the highest sources of damage.
                    The best regular strength weapon can deal very high damage, around the 1000-1500.
                    The best sorcery however can deal up to 4000 damage.
                </p>
